	<description>A "Lite" Vehicle Framework (Originally from Jecstools), updated and made standalone under the MIT license. Full credit to Jecrell and the others who helped make it possible in the first place, all I've done is make it work again. 
		
Purely did this so I have a functional and playable option for testing my vehicle textures on prior to SmashPhil releasing a stable version of his framework. I likely won't provide support for compatibility or any other issues.</description>
